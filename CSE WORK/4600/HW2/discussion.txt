How I approached this: 

I assumed only C is allowed in this class. Therefore my process "object" is
really just a typedefed struct with unsigned ints in it.

Some possible (not set in stone) functions and methodology will be: 

double gaussRand()	// adapted from http://c-faq.com/lib/gaussian
		   	// Using this to generate a normal distribution
			// Not confident this will work as expected

rand()			// from the stdlib, initializing and giving it
			// a range so it gives what was asked for in the spec

Some getter functions:

getProcessID()
getNumOfCycles()
getMemSize()

Maybe a display function: void display()

for loops: gonna use these to simulate a "dice roll" with the processes. 

More to follow once I get in the zone with this.   

Ok, we need constants in accordance w/ the specs: 

mincycles = 1000
maxcycles = 11000
avgcycles = 6000
minmemfootprint = 1kb
maxmemfootprint = 100 kb
avgmemfootprint= 20kb
