So based on the results generated by the increasing file size, it appears that somewhere between 200 and 400 KB,
the file size caused the read time to grow nearly exponentially for some reason. This could be due to a number of factors,
not limited to:

- average "busy-ness" of the VM (relatively high number of active processes when compared to a baseline)
- disk speeds
- Possibly load? Or number of active users?
